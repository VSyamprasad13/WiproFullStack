Assignment 1: Write a SELECT query to retrieve all columns from a 'customers' table, and modify it to return only the customer name and email address for customers in a specific city.
 
Assignment 2: Craft a query using an INNER JOIN to combine 'orders' and 'customers' tables for customers in a specified region, and a LEFT JOIN to display all customers including those without orders.
 
Assignment 3: Utilize a subquery to find customers who have placed orders above the average order value, and write a UNION query to combine two SELECT statements with the same number of columns.
